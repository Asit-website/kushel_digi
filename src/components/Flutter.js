                <h4>Perfect for MVP</h4>
                <p>
                  Flutter is a perfect platform for prototyping and running a
                  minimum viable product (MVP). A simple app prototype can be
                  built within the shortest terms. With Android, similar
                  development requires much more time.

                <h4>Framework applicability</h4>
                <p>
                  The experience of our flutter development company has shown
                  that Flutter can cover the needs of most mobile development
                  requests, while functionality and sophistication of the
                  technology allow using it in many areas.

                <h4>Long-term prospects</h4>
                <p>
                  Flutter is an open source project, so developers can support
                  it independently. It will not be closed in the foreseeable
                  future.
                </p>

                <img src={plan3} alt="" />
                <h4>Saving on support</h4>
                <p>
                  The need for application support arises immediately after the
                  release. Sometimes, it's technical support that is required
                  when updating the OS, which is followed by bugs that need to
                  be fixed. However, much more often, developers need to work on
                  further development of the functions. Support of an app with a
                  general code is much cheaper and easier than support of two
                  apps for different platforms.
